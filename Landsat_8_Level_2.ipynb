    "## About the Landsat Missions\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief.\" [[1](#References)] \n",
    "\n",
    "\"In the mid-1960s an ambitious effort to develop and launch the first civilian Earth observation satellite was started. The goal was achieved on July 23, 1972, with the launch of the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1), which was later renamed Landsat 1. The launches of Landsat 2, Landsat 3, and Landsat 4 followed in 1975, 1978, and 1982, respectively. When Landsat 5 was launched in 1984, no one could have predicted that the satellite would continue to deliver high quality, global data of Earth's land surfaces for 28 years and 10 months until its retirement in June, 2013. Landsat 6, however, failed to achieve orbit in 1993. Landsat 7 was successfully launched in 1999 and, along with Landsat 8 launched in 2013, continues to provide daily global data. Landsat 9 is planned to be launched in late 2020.\" [[2](#References)]\n",

    "The Landsat 8 satellite images the entire Earth every 16 days in an 8-day offset from Landsat 7. Providing moderate-resolution imagery, from 15 meters to 100 meters, of Earth's land surface and polar regions. The Landsat 8 mission objective is to provide timely, high quality visible and infrared images of all landmass and near-coastal areas on the Earth, continually refreshing an existing Landsat database. Landsat 8 operates in the visible, near-infrared, short wave infrared, and thermal infrared spectrums. Landsat 8 captures more than 700 scenes a day. \n",
