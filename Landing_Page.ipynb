    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Open Data Cube (ODC) Sandbox. Here you can access an instance of the ODC that has data indexed and ready to go. This sandbox utilises data products available on AWS' Landsat public dataset bucket on S3 (see: https://docs.opendata.aws/landsat-pds/readme.html). \n",

    "<img src=\"images/indexed_areas.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who code in Python can use this space to explore using the ODC API to interact with indexed products and the potential of accessing earth observation data on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "And for the novice users we've developed prototype apps that allow you to explore any location in thw world in a simple  graphical user interface that is using stored macro commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ODC\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ODC](https://github.com/opendatacube) provides an integrated gridded data analysis environment capable of delivering decades of analysis ready earth observation satellite and related data from multiple satellite and other acquisition systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODC initiative seeks to increase the value and impact of global Earth obervation satellite data by providing an open and freely accessible exploitation archectecture and to foster a community to develop, sustain, and grow the techonology and the breadth and depth of its application. To read more see the [ODC Initiative Whitepaper](https://github.com/opendatacube/documentation/blob/master/Roadmap/ODC%20White%20Paper.md)\n",
